      "description": "## üåä Hi there\n\nPassionate about leveraging technology for positive change, I am a self-taught programmer with a background in environmental health. My journey from environmental studies to software development fuels my commitment to creating impactful solutions that benefit individuals and society at large.\n\n## üë®‚Äçüíª Coding Philosophy\n\nMy coding philosophy revolves around valuing people and their collaborative efforts over individual prowess. I firmly believe that effective teamwork and seamless collaboration are the keystones to exceptional software development. Embracing Extreme Programming (XP) principles has been integral to my approach. These values not only foster a conducive environment for collective problem-solving but also ensure the delivery of high-quality, maintainable code and customer value. With a focus on fostering a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility, I try to integrate Lean and XP concepts to prioritize teamwork and people-centric and technical development practices in my coding endeavors.\n\n## üî≠ Current Role\n\nI currently lead a development team at Freshly Cosmetics on an internal project focused on streamlining operations within our logistics center. I initiated a comprehensive refactoring of the codebase, introducing unit and integration tests, and restructuring the architecture with a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach and hexagonal architecture principles using both tactical and technical patterns. This has enhanced both the performance and maintainability of the project, enabling faster and more reliable feature releases. I've also implemented Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices to improve code quality and foster team ownership of the code. Additionally, I introduced Docker for consistent development environments, automated deployments to streamline release cycles, and integrated Amazon SQS for efficient pub/sub messaging within our system. These improvements have significantly boosted operational efficiency, supporting our logistics team with a robust, scalable solution.",

                "description": "Over six years, I played a key role in scaling the development team, leading technical projects, and driving process improvements within a dynamic and evolving e-commerce environment.\n\nIn **2019**, I joined a small team as a fullstack developer but soon tasked with defining the foundations, methodologies, and processes necessary to scale the development team. As the team grew from 4 to 6 developers, I took on dual responsibilities as a developer and technical leader, guiding the team in Agile practices and acting as a Scrum Master. This foundation set the stage for the company's broader expansion to 22 developers.\n\nIn the technical aspect I lead a new specific product in our ecommerce platform where customers could set up recurring purchases of their favorite products, it was used VueJS for the front-end and backend APIs with PHP.\n\nBy **2020**, we had successfully established three specialized product-focused teams. I contributed to adapting company-wide OKRs into our development processes, ensuring alignment and efficiency. A major technical challenge during this time was developing a new checkout process to support the launch of a digital subscription product, offering exclusive benefits to customers. This initiative required designing a seamless, high-performance user experience while integrating complex subscription management features. The project also involved optimizing payment processing workflows and ensuring compatibility with existing e-commerce infrastructure.\n\nDuring this time, I also advocated for Agile practices across departments, introducing Scrum, Kanban, retrospectives, and Specification by Example to improve workflows in logistics and customer service. Additionally, I provided Git training to enhance version control practices.\n\nIn **2021**, my role evolved as the team continued to grow. I became a mentor to other developers, participated in hiring interviews, and led a product team focused on synchronizing the e-commerce platform with the company‚Äôs ERP. We refactored the ERP connector, introducing Lean and XP practices for shorter development cycles and adopting Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) to improve product quality and alignment.\n\nFollowing organizational changes in **2022**, I transitioned to leading a team dedicated to customer service tools, including integrations between the e-commerce platform and the CRM. I provided strong support to the Product Owner while delivering solutions for managing orders, returns, and product reviews. With this projects we specially focused in the user experience of both customers and and our customer service team, technically speaking we introduced the usage of web components to have a reusable set of components to be used on other products.\n\nIn **2023**, the company explored entering the B2B market, which involved migrating the e-commerce platform to Shopify. I led the technical decoupling of the warehouse management application from the e-commerce platform, internalizing a previously outsourced project. This effort included implementing a messaging queue system with Amazon SQS, conducting Event Storming workshops, and shifting toward an Event-Driven Architecture. Despite the eventual cancellation of the Shopify migration, the decoupling ensured the warehouse application remained unaffected and functional.\n\nDuring **2024**, we focused on iterating and enhancing the warehouse application, improving its UX, integrating new carriers, and strengthening order tracking. I fostered a culture of documentation and standardization, consolidating application documentation and establishing team coding standards. Additionally, I initiated a project for B2B order management using the existing queue-based architecture. Although the project was ultimately paused due to layoffs, it demonstrated the potential of AsyncAPI for automated documentation and cross-channel order ingestion.\n\nThis period highlights my growth as a technical leader, my ability to adapt to changing business needs, and my contributions to scaling teams, improving workflows, and delivering high-quality technical solutions."

My role primarily focused on frontend development, but I occasionally worked on backend tasks using Java and Hibernate. Starting with limited experience in these technologies, I quickly adapted and took on greater responsibilities, becoming proficient in Angular and testing with Nightwatch.js. The team leveraged Jenkins for CI/CD and Jira for project management, ensuring smooth and efficient workflows. Additionally, we used Angular components to create a mobile application with Ionic, allowing me to expand my skills into hybrid mobile development\n\nBy 2018, I transitioned to a new project, maintaining and improving a Deutsche Bank application designed for asset managers. My work centered on two microfrontends within a Backbase-based platform. A key achievement during this time was leading the migration from SVN to Git, modernizing the team‚Äôs version control processes. Collaborating closely with the Product Owners, I implemented new features to meet business requirements while ensuring high-quality standards. Working in a strictly frontend-focused team, I embraced Scrum practices with three-week sprints, collaborating with the Scrum Master to improve team performance and Agile practices. Deployment processes were managed through TeamCity, further enhancing the project‚Äôs technical efficiency.\n\nThese experiences allowed me to grow from a junior role into a senior position, demonstrating my ability to adapt to new technologies, take on leadership responsibilities, and contribute to both technical and organizational success.\n"

This architecture ensured better separation of concerns, scalability, and long-term maintainability.\n\nAdditionally, we emphasized the role of Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices in guiding the implementation. By leveraging TDD, we built a robust and reliable integration layer while fostering a culture of quality and collaboration.\n\nThe presentation highlighted key lessons learned, challenges faced, and how this initiative has not only solved a pressing issue but also laid the groundwork for more resilient systems and practices across the IT department."

    "goodPractices": "In my work, I adhere to best practices that ensure quality and adaptability across projects. I consistently apply SOLID principles and prioritize clean code standards, maintaining clarity and scalability in my codebase. I believe in adapting architectural choices to the specific needs of each project rather than being bound to a single model. Testing is fundamental in my workflow; I define each story's 'definition of done' based on acceptance criteria and implement comprehensive automated testing. This approach not only ensures code reliability but also facilitates smoother, more predictable development and deployment cycles",
